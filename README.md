# SQF
SQF is an language used in Arma 3 engine, I have had some good experience with it and it helped me learn how game scripting works.

I am still in the process of learning it, but I made some really good progress.

The scripts sent to this repository are:
- Orbital script made from in-game projectiles with added particles and camera shake for immersive effect

- Basic zombie script that follow players, play an animation and cause damage to the closest player
